# C-and-C--HW
A collection of all my assignments from my Programming in C and C++ university course. Constructor University Fall 2024 

This repository contains my C and C++ programming assignments from my first year of university. The assignments are organized by week and reflect the core topics typically covered in an introductory programming course.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a weekly assignment:

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- ✅ Basic syntax, I/O
- 📊 Data types, operators, control flow
- 🔁 Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- 🧮 Functions, scope, recursion
- 📦 Arrays, multidimensional arrays
- 🧷 Pointers, pointer arithmetic
- 📚 Structures and unions
- 📄 File input/output
- 🧠 Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`, `new`, `delete`)
- 🔃 Sorting and searching algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Binary Search)
- 🧬 Classes, encapsulation, constructors/destructors
- 🧱 Inheritance and class hierarchies
- 🔄 Polymorphism and virtual functions
- 🧪 Final review project (integrates multiple topics)

## 🛠️ How to Run

### C Programs:
